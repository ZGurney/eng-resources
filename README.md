# Engineering Resources for Schools

A third year extension activity in the MEng engineering course at the University of Cambridge.

## Brief

As described by the [brief](resources/brief-2020.pdf) set by Dr. Hugh Shercliff.

### What are the problems being addressed?

- Although 34% of students taking maths and physics at A-level go on to study engineering (including architecture) degrees at university, little to no reference is made to place concepts within the context of engineering.
- Only 22% of entries who continue with maths and physics after the age of 16 are women, and corresponding thus to low proportions in engineering degrees as well.

### What opportunities does this present?

- Developing teaching resources that set existing curriculum concepts within the context of engineering challenges.

### What is the requirements and scope of this project?

- The resources must be tied to sections of the national curriculum in the UK for secondary school students.
- The resources must not stray beyond the curriculum objectives due to the teaching capacity of schools, or present these as extension material.
- The resources must be of high quality and easy to use by teachers who may be busy and not trained in engineering contexts.
- A topic area and target age group must be selected to focus on.

### What are the objectives of this project?

- Supporting teaching of maths and science through engineering contexts.
- Encouraging "thinking like an engineer".
- Exploiting contexts that appeal to women students.
