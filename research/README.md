# Research

- Placing questions within contexts of sustainability and healthcare has been shown to be successful in addressing the male-female balance in engineering

## Structure of UK national curriculum

- Different exam boards exist:
  - Edexcel
  - AQA
  - OCR

### Table: GCSE physics practicals covered by main exam boards

In addition, resources are being developed at the University of Cambridge with the same aim of this project at the following links:

1. [GCSE physics resources](http://www-materials.eng.cam.ac.uk/scienceforengineering/index.html)
2. [A-level physics resources](http://www-materials.eng.cam.ac.uk/physicsforengineering/index.html)

## Possible resource types

1. **Topic introductions** to introduce engineering applications and questions around key concepts from the syllabus.
2. **Exam-style questions** to build on existing exam questions towards engineering design thinking.
3. **Posters on common practicals** to emphasise their importance and relevance to the real world.
4. **Quick revision guides** to refresh key concepts.
5. **Topic extensions** for enthusiastic or prospective engineering applicants with practical examples.
6. **Brain teasers** to stimulate awareness about everyday applications

## Possible pathways

| Subject | Possible topics or ideas |
|---|---|
| Maths | Complex numbers in electrical circuits; visual representations of advanced mathematics |
| Physics | Moments; momentum; waves; refraction and reflection; thermal radiation; series and parallel circuits |
| Biology |  |
